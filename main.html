	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<!-- First paragraph containing 'Time complexity' and 'efficient' -->
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. Writing efficient code often requires optimizing time complexity to reduce the algorithm's runtime.</p>

	<!-- Second paragraph containing 'Space Complexity', 'O(n)', and making 'Space Complexity' bold -->
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> represents the total memory or space required by the algorithm. Optimizing <b>Space Complexity</b> helps in minimizing resource usage, especially when dealing with large datasets. A common space complexity is O(n).</p>
